# HP t730 — Frigate & IoT Security Lab

## Project Overview

This project documents the design, implementation, and testing of a low-cost home security and networking lab built around a refurbished HP t730 Thin Client.

The goal is to explore network segmentation, virtualization, firewall management, local video surveillance, and IoT security before implementing a permanent UniFi home network.

**Initial hardware investment: $80**

## Project Objectives

- Deploy Proxmox VE as a virtualization platform.
- Configure OPNsense for network segmentation and firewall testing.
- Deploy Frigate for local IP-camera recording and object detection.
- Create isolated networks for cameras and IoT devices.
- Implement and validate firewall rules between networks.
- Test system reliability, resource usage, and performance.
- Document configuration decisions, troubleshooting, and lessons learned.

## Hardware Baseline

| Component | Specification |
|---|---|
| Device | HP t730 Thin Client |
| Processor | AMD RX-427BB |
| Memory | 8GB DDR3L (2 × 4GB) |
| Storage | 128GB M.2 SATA SSD |
| Operating System at purchase | Windows 11 |
| Network | Integrated Gigabit Ethernet |
| Expansion | PCIe slot |
| Cost | $80 |

Hardware specifications will be verified and updated throughout the project.

## Planned Architecture

AT&T Fiber → Google Nest WiFi Pro → HP t730 (Proxmox) → OPNsense lab network

Frigate will operate within the lab environment, with network isolation implemented and tested in later phases.

The existing household network will remain operational during initial development.

## Project Phases

- [x] Phase 1: Acquire and inspect hardware
- [ ] Phase 2: Validate hardware and BIOS settings
- [ ] Phase 3: Install and configure Proxmox VE
- [ ] Phase 4: Deploy OPNsense and test network segmentation
- [ ] Phase 5: Install Frigate and connect a test camera
- [ ] Phase 6: Evaluate IoT isolation and security rules
- [ ] Phase 7: Document performance, results, and future improvements

## Long-Term Vision

Use the results of this proof-of-concept to design a production home network incorporating UniFi networking equipment, VLAN segmentation, PoE cameras, local recording, and additional security controls.

## Project Status

**Current stage:** Hardware inspection and validation

**Next milestone:** Complete the SSD discrepancy resolution and verify hardware operation.
